The inventory was designed with the intention to move towards a more generic / standalone structure so it can be integrated into any framework without too much hassle. I will be writing a guide for manually setting up support _sometime soonâ„¢_. In the mean-time, it will work without any alterations if using the latest updates to **[ESX Legacy](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy)**.

Experimental support for [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) has been added, but requires a recent installation. Do not expect 100% compatibility or support.
